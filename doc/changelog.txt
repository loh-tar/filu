============
ManagerF
----------
 - AddFiPage has now three symbol edit lines, so you can more comfortable add
   new FIs by fill out the fields by hand. You could also add new symbols to an
   existing FI by enter only an existing symbol in 'RefSymbol' (left name/type
   empty) and the new in one the new lines.
 - The upper script launcher/selector is still not very useful. But the "Filu-
   Provider" and the underlying "database" was updated.
 - Save/Restore last used settings. Window position and geometry sadly still not
   handled.
 - Has now a message line at the bottom where some feedback is given. The
   quality of the info need improvements.
 - New page 'Log Book' where are all messages collected for your reference.
 - Some new icons but not as the best. Are you artistic talented?

New Snapshot
--------------
To update from the 2010-07-02 snapshot you have *not* to reinstall the database.
Read again the readme how to compile the progs now and remove the added Qt4.3.5
lines in your ~/.bashrc file.


2010-11-03
  InspectorF: Fix some minor bugs. Needs still many improvements.
  ManagerF:   Fix some hanging at FiPage when search field was cleared.

2010-11-02
  All Parts:  Oops! Close many memory leaks detected by running Valgrind. It
              seems that there are some memory leaks in the Qt library too, but
              maybe I'm wrong.

2010-10-26
              Change the build system from qmake to cmake. Read again the readme
              for updated install instructions if you are a skilled Filu user.

2010-10-25
  Filu:       Fix a bug with my hard coded user name when export chart objects.

2010-06-25
              homepage updated with a nicer look.

2010-06-14
  ManagerF:   fix at AddFi-Page, adding FIs or Symbols as described in
              doc/first-steps.txt has not worked.

2010-06-01
              Hello World! The Filu source is now online at Gitorious and
              SourceForge.

2010-05-25
  doc:        add hacking-filu-power-indicators.txt
  calc:       add FILU(...)

2010-05-23
  Filu:       add/change handling of Filu Power Indictors.

2010-05-22
  database:   review indicator stuff. Change orig Component Counter to return
              only one row with beef. Returns now percent values, rename to
              ccp.

2010-05-18
  Filu:       review what could be removed, change return value of most
              function from bool to int, add error code enums.

2010-05-17
  database:   review content and rename something, add new functions.
  All Parts:  change FiMi to Filu, remove unused stuff, update copyright notice.

2010-05-16
  doc:        review Master-of-imp-files.ods, now with nice auto fillings.

2010-05-12
  calc:       add PRIMARY(...), change WATCHDOGS(...) and INCLUDE(...).

2010-05-10
  CalcType:   add some functions which simplified the code of each CalcFoo.cpp
              a little bit.

2010-05-08
  FClass:     add hasError(), removeErrorText(), clearErrors().
  All Parts:  use new error handling stuff.
  Indicator:  on error behavior optimized, also IndicatorPainter.

2010-05-07
  calc:       remove BOOL and MATH, both is supported by MUP, but much better.
  Indicator:  add constants for days and month names, add WEEK.

2010-05-06
  Trader:     some fixes.
  doc:        review trading-rule-file-format.txt, indicator-file-format.txt,
              hacking-c++.txt.

2010-05-03
  AgentF:     change the daemon stuff code, think its now easier to understand.
              Change the command switches from single - to nothing, it's more
              common.

2010-04-24
  Qt bug:     I have fixed this in the Qt git master source and placed a merge
              request. I'm eager what Nokia will say about this.

2010-04-21
  Gitorious:  I opened an accound there and be hopefully soon online with Filu.

2010-04-14
  faq.txt:    added to doc directory.

2010-04-13
  RcFile:     rename the key FiMiHome to FiluHome and capitalized the subfolders
              of FiluHome. Change the default home from hidden ~/.Filu to ~/Filu
  LaunchPad:  the called program could now take [Market], [MarketId], [FiId],
              [Provider] and of course still [Symbol] (now capitalized) as
              parameter. The launch pad config file has a new settings entry
              AllMarkets=true/false and is now located at ~/Filu/LaunchPads/
              with an .ini suffix. Added doc/launchpad-file-format.txt.

2010-04-11
  All parts:  as 2010-04-07 homework: redundant RcFile stuff removed and code
              reviewed to clear up #include in header files. Try always only to
              use class in the header and place #include in *.cpp.
  FObject:    renamed to FClass. Add a new FObject inherited by QObject similar
              to FWidget by QWidget. Both inherited by FClass. I hope this
              is commonly acceptable and not a design nightmare. FClass has FiMi
              and RcFile as members and both will only used once in a program to
              save resources.

2010-04-08
  RcFile:     changed from good style of coding to use enum as key to bad one
              with string, just because I'm lazy :-/ The benefit is that it is
              more ease to use, more flexible. See entry at 2010-04-07.
  AgentF:     replace QSettings stuff with mRcFile.
  FiMi:       according to 2010-03-20 to drop the independency, it is
              consequently to use here also mRcFile.

2010-04-07
              changed *.pro files. The compiled files will now placed in own
              directories below FiluSource/tmp to avoid pulluting the source
              tree.
  FObject:    Add mRcFile, hope is useful.
              TODO: remove redundant RcFile stuff in all parts.

2010-04-01
  common:     Exporter/Importer handle now most of all data. Now we have a
              backup and restore solution. The speed is not like turbo powered
              when handle 30.000 eod bars but how cares, it works.
              TODO: backtest data stuff.

2010-04-01
  common:     add FObject::check4FiluError(), I hope is useful.
              TODO: review all project code parts to use it.

2010-03-28
  FiMi:       add setSqlParm(). Allows a most flexible way to call any new SQL
              without the need to write a special FiMi function. Works together
              with execSql() which was introduced with InspectorF.cpp. The harm
              is of cause that you must know how the sql looks like, the FiMi
              include file doesn't tell you. And in case of a sql modification
              you don't know which other program parts may affected.

2010-03-27
              clean up Filu/database. Remove old stuff from Christian which I
              never will use. Review the configure script and the *.sql files,
              but they still needs more attention.

2010-03-20
              change the project name from FiMi to Filu. Drop the Idea with a
              universal library without dependencies to the FiMi, sorry, Filu
              programs. Now are all libraries located in sub directories below
              Filu/libs and will build only one library libFilu. Therefore the
              *.pro files was changed, but I'm not quite happy. Needs work.

2010-03-15
  common:     add Exporter.cpp, the counterpart to Importer.cpp.
  agentf:     add "-exp" command, witch use the new Exporter class. Details
              about the command switches are located in doc/export-data.txt.

2010-02-20
  performerf: added a second group navi. Now we can quit simple copy entries
              between groups.

2009-09-07
  calc:       add VIEWNAME(...) and WATCHDOGS(...)

2009-09-05
  graphics:   add the basis for chart objects. To add a chart object chose one
              from the menu in performerf and place it somewhere on the chart.
              Changing and moving are almost as usual apart from that don't hold
              down the left button while moving. Play around and you will see.
              Pressing Del removes an selected CO.
              Available chart objects are right now only "Line".

2009-08-19
  performerf: add a launch pad to the main tool bar which could start any
              application with any parameter list. The tag [symbol] in the
              command line is substituted with a symbol of the current viewing
              FI. To add/change the default button look into ~/.FiMi/LaunchPad.
              I think it's self explained.

2009-08-06
  graphics:   added a data view to IndicatorWidget.cpp. Like the indicator
              picker at the left is this view accessible at the right edge of
              the plotsheet. Just simple move the splitter.

2009-08-03
  graphics:   polished plot code and x-scale plotting.
              Holding down the Ctrl-Key accelerate the scrolling of the chart.

2009-07-28
  calc:       add MUP(<expression>) This calls the muParser library.
              <expression> could be a full complex math expression. For details
              of supported operators and functions see:
              http://muparser.sourceforge.net/mup_features.html#idDef2

2009-07-22
  agentf:     code polished and added some new commands.
              "-daemon" where he read from stdin and execute each command line
              he read until Ctrl+D is pressed. similar to "-rcf".
              "-ps", prints the settings.
              "-imp" takes now also a file name.
              Furthermore he starts now multiple instances to do a big job. e.g.
              at "-full" to download quotes parallel. The amount of instances is
              configurable in the settings file.

2009-07-19
  agentf:     add new command "-addSplit"

2009-07-17
  inspectorf: ...added to progs. It's the backtester with automated rule and
              indicator parameter substitute. Each constant is changeable.
              Edit the constants in the Strategy-Tab encapsulated in braces {}
              in two ways:
              {10;12;14} each of the value is used. No limit of values.
              {10-20 i 2} from 10 to 20 in steps of 2 is used.

2009-07-10
  agentf:     change commands to "-imp" and "-rcf"
  libf:       Importer.cpp now imports split data

2009-07-05
  graphics:   add a second color paint mode to PLOT(CANDLE,...)
              <high>-color is line color if close > prevClose, default green
              <low>-color  is line color if close < prevClose, default red
              <open>-color is body fill color if close > open, default black
              So far no change, but when <close>-color is set then:
              <close>-color is body fill color if close < open

2009-07-04
  calc:       add SIMTRADE(<trading-rule-file-name>), it runs a trading
              simulation and add a lot of variables to the indicator.
              e.g. TotalBalance. Furthermore will the color of OPEN, HIGH, LOW
              CLOSE changed. So PLOT(CANDLE, FI()) visualise the trading.
              For details look doc/trading-rule-file-format.txt

2009-06-18
  calc:       add <bool> = BETWEEN(<lowBorder>, <highBorder>, <foo1>[, <foon>])
              <bool> comes true when each value of foo1-n is in a range of
              lowBorder and highBorder

2009-06-13
  calc:       add SETCOLOR(<variable>, <true-color>, <false-color>)

2009-06-10
  agentf:     change the file format of "-impFi". Details now in
              doc/import-file-format.txt

2009-06-03
              long time is nothing happens with this project because of private
              things. But the world was still turning. Trolltech was bought by
              Nokia. Qt 4.5 was released, and comes with a new "feature". For
              detail look at Qt's Task Tracker ID 237876. So I was forced to
              download the sources of Qt 4.3.5 :-(
              Furthermore don't work fetchFi_yahoo.pl. After googling it seems
              related on changes by yahoo. The perl finance quote have a new
              version 1.16 to fix the problem, but...I didn't got it running :-(

2007-08-01
  diggerf:    uploaded. It's the scanner tool. If the variable "SCAN4" in an
              indicator is greater null the FI will added to the group
              "ScanResults/<indicatorName>"

2007-07-29
  calc:       add <var2> = REF(<var1>, <back-ref-value>)

2007-07-27
  graphics:   add PLOT(DASHLINE, <var>), well...could be improved :-/

2007-07-26
  calc:       add <var> = CROSS(<foo1>, <foo2>, <type>)
              <type> can be: UP, DOWN, BOTH
  performerf: 1st draft uploaded. Use drag&drop to add FIs to groups. Drag FIs
              or groups out to remove them.

2007-07-14
  agentf:     new command "-impFi", reads from stdin
              infos to the expected file format look into
              progs/libf/common/Importer.h

2007-07-12
  calc &      add new indicator key "*AddToGroup=<foo>". When the indicator file
  graphics:   contains somewhere a line with above key, the indicator appears
              in that group in the new indicator picker window lefthand of the
              chart window. Include so much "*AddToGroup=" as you like

2007-07-02
  calc:       add TA-Lib support

  graphics:   add y-scale, adjust chart painting - no more fidget at the right
              hand side while density changes, no half painted last candle

2007-06-23
  graphics:   add PLOT(HISTOGRAM, <var>) and PLOT(HISTOGRAMBAR, <var>)
  calc:       add <var> = BOOL(<var1> <operator> <var2>)
                operators are <, >, =, <=, >=, <>, &, |
                as TRUE is all bigger than 0.0 interpreted
                if <boolExp> is TRUE variable is set to 1.0

2007-06-22
  graphics:   add PLOT(CANDLE, FI())
                  PLOT(CANDLE, <open>, <high>, <low>, <close>, <volume>)
                  <volume> is not used currently
              <high>-color is line color if close > prevClose, default green
              <low>-color  is line color if close < prevClose, default red
              <open>-color is body fill color if win-day, default black
                           if it's a lost-day, line color is used as fill color

2007-06-21

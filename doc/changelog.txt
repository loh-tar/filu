Damn Santa Claus Snapshot
---------------------------
You have your shoes polished!

A lot of changes at not so interesting parts. It is poor tested, so I hope it
make not to much trouble. It should be easier to install and compile faster.
Anyway we have some nice user experience improvements.

PerformerF and ManagerF shows tables a little spaces sparing and without grids.
ManagerF can now hide the page icons by a splitter and the indicator editor
is a little bit less pesky.

PerformerF is now watching the used indicator and reload them if edited which
is very nice while indicator development. The indicator picker remember his
last selection.

AgentF has now better help text, write nicer into the log file and has new
devilish commands. That's, and because all is almost untested, is why the
snapshot is 'damn' ;-)

An update should work without special treatments. Take a look at the readme
and go on reading the changelog to notice what may affect you.

PS: At 6th of December in Germany comes 'Der Nikolaus' and places some candy
in well polished shoes.

============
Sundries
----------
 - SourceTree: BIG change! Centralize all SQLs below FiluSource/database/
 - Remove perl config script and the complete make db procedure
 - DB creation and Filu schema creation are now two independed steps.
   The (pure) database is created by 'make init-filu' and the filu schema
   on the fly like the user schema. That may change in the future to be done
   by an extra command


2012-11-30
============
Sundries
----------
 - Qt SQL Driver Bug: Add a precompiled driver to the source tree
   but it's *not* well tested
 - Removed several bugged included <QtGui> and <QtCore>. Compiles now in half

2011-09-09
============
New Snapshot
--------------
Brings so much changes under the hood that an update from the last snapshot may
fail, you are warned! The most important new stuff is depot management on the
command line. For the more detailed list of changes go on reading here.

To upgrade from the Santa Snapshot you have to ex/import your DB with your
*old* progs as follows. Assuming you have a default installation you have to do:

  [~/somewhere]$ agentf exp --toFile ExportedFiluData.imp --fiNames --symbols \
  --splits --fiTypes --symbolTypes --markets --co --groups --eodRaw

If you like omit the '--eodRaw' switch because that take a lot of time. Rename
your ~/Filu directory and your ~/.config/Filu.conf file to something else. Then
compile and install the new snapshot. To Create a new DB run:

  [FiluSource-2011-09-09/database]$ ./configure -d filu20110909 -U
  [FiluSource-2011-09-09/database]$ sudo make install

There will a lot stuff printed, lines like "INFO:  New ErrorType:.." are Ok.
After complie and install the new progs run:

  [~/somewhere]$ agentf --config DatabaseName=filu20110909

That create the new user schema and print a lot lines. Now import your data.
Because the default dates was changed pipe the exported data thru sed.
Furthermore it is recommend to change all NASDAQ to NYSE because the Yahoo
scripts will only deliver NYSE. But that's your decision.

  [~/somewhere]$ sed 's/3000-12-31/3000-01-01/g' ExportedFiluData.imp | \
  agentf imp --config DatabaseName=filu20110909

If all looks good add to your ~/.config/Filu.conf DatabaseName=filu20110909.
Should you run in to big trouble could you re-install the progs from your Santa
snapshot and use your existing Filu.

Good luck!


2011-09-08
============
Sundries
----------
 - DB, Move currency from depot to broker.
 - FiluU, Change enums eOrderFoo.

These small notes discribes many changes under the hood which needs a lot of
attention if you like to update your Filu.

Save these lines as 'filu-dbfix-2011-09-08.sql'.

  -- Move currency from depot to broker
  \set user '' `echo 'user_'$USER` ''
  \set filu 'filu'
  DELETE FROM :user.depot;
  DELETE FROM :filu.broker;
  ALTER TABLE :filu.market DROP CONSTRAINT market_currency_fi_id_fkey;
  ALTER TABLE :filu.market ADD FOREIGN KEY(currency_fi_id)
    REFERENCES filu.fi (fi_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;
  ALTER TABLE :filu.broker ADD COLUMN currency_fi_id  int4 NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE :filu.broker ADD FOREIGN KEY(currency_fi_id)
    REFERENCES :filu.fi(fi_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT;
  INSERT INTO :filu.error(caption, etext) VALUES('BrokerNF', 'Broker not
found.');
  ALTER TABLE :user.depot DROP COLUMN currency ;

To save most of the depot stuff you could run with your *old* progs:

  agentf depots lsd --lso m 2>backup.depot

But that will lost the account data and all broker, sorry. Afterwards edit the
backup file to become an import file.

Compile and install *now* the new code and run:

  psql filu filu --file /path-to/filu-dbfix-2011-09-08.sql
  agentf filu --update
  agentf imp /path-to/your-fixed-backup.depot

Good luck!


2011-09-07
============
Depots
--------
 - Change option '--depotId' to '--dpid'.
 - Add optional parameter m|t to '--lso'.
 - Add command '--delete' (depot).
 - Add command '--cancel' (order).
 - Add command '--cho' (change order).
 - Improve command parsing to omit -- at first cmd/switch.

To get these working you have to fix your existing Filu-DB.
Save these lines as 'filu-dbfix-2011-09-04.sql'.

  -- Change 'RESTRICT' to 'CASCADE' at depot stuff
  \set user '' `echo 'user_'$USER` ''
  ALTER TABLE :user.account DROP CONSTRAINT account_depot_id_fkey;
  ALTER TABLE :user.account ADD FOREIGN KEY(depot_id)
    REFERENCES :user.depot(depot_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
  ALTER TABLE :user.depotpos DROP CONSTRAINT depotpos_depot_id_fkey;
  ALTER TABLE :user.depotpos ADD FOREIGN KEY(depot_id)
    REFERENCES :user.depot(depot_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
  ALTER TABLE :user.order DROP CONSTRAINT order_depot_id_fkey;
  ALTER TABLE :user.order ADD FOREIGN KEY(depot_id)
    REFERENCES :user.depot(depot_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

Supposed that you use a default configuration run now:

  psql filu filu --file /path-to/filu-dbfix-2011-09-04.sql

Here is the first 'filu' the DB name and the second the Postgres User/Role.
These fix only the user tables of Filu and will not lost data. So if you use
Filu in a multi user environment has each user to run these command.

RcFile
--------
 - Change key VerboseLevel to Verbose
 - Change key SqlDebugLevel to SqlDebug

PerformerF
------------
 - Rename ZoomOutWidget to ZoomWidget. This change also the used IndicatorSet

2011-02-28
============

 - New Key *ScanFreq. See doc/indicator-file-format.txt


2010-12-24
============
Santa Claus Snapshot
----------------------
Brings nice improvements at ManagerF, mostly his AddFiPage. For the list of
changes go on reading here.

To update from the 2010-12-01 snapshot only compile and install the progs. To be
sure that the new Yahoo scripts are working take a look at the readme for
updated Perl dependencies.

 - Change the icons at ManagerF.
 - Add system menu entries. Look at 'Office'.


2010-12-19

------------------------
 - Use of Importers new function makeNameNice().
 - Prevent segfault when Header is missing.

   the selected FI is an Index.

Yahoo Scripts
---------------
 - New module Yahoo.pm, holds sub routines.
 - Complete replace of fetchFi, but recycle well working old parts.

--------
 - Change the agentf.log file path to ~/Filu.


2010-12-01
============
New Snapshot
--------------
Brings a lot of nice GUI improvements, some bug fixes but no essential new
stuff. For the list of changes go on reading here.

To update from the 2010-11-04 snapshot read chapter 1 of the readme. Because
there was a fix in the database functions you should update these too. Assumed
you use a default installation cd into FiluSource-2010-12-01/database and do:
  ./configure -DSUT
  sudo make install

Your data will not be lost. Anyway is it always a good idea to make a backup
before to install an update.


2010-11-28
============
General
---------
 - Some memory leaks closed and bugs poisoned. Thanks to Valgrind.

Indicator Widget
------------------
 - Improve to keep the X-Scale cursor at the last date position when a new set
   was load.
 - Place the cursor at the correct position when add a new IndicatorWindow.
 - Paint the grid independent of the scale.
 - Paint a tiny marker, like a cross hair, into the chart. The marker is placed
   at the PRIMARY() value.
 - Try to keep the X-Scale cursor at the last date position while scrolling.
 - Don't paint the cursor date right from the chart area.
 - Close the small gap at the X/Y-Scale junction.
 - Avoid Y-Scale overwrite.
 - Don't let the grid nibble at the base line anymore.
 - Chart X-Adjustment fine tuned

Chart Objects
---------------
 - Fix: Setting the anchor value in the edit window now work properly.


2010-11-25
============
Indicator Widget
------------------
 - Move settings key 'ShowYScale' from individual group [n] to [General]. If
   you had make an update may your usual YScale setting therefore differ.


2010-11-24
============
IndiSetPad
------------
 - Add a SetSelector. These QComboBox displays the current used indicator set
   and let you choose one of all existing sets.
 - Remove in the edit window the IndicatorCount field.
 - Replace in the edit window the Name field with an editable QComboBox. These
   box list all existing sets.

Indicator Widget
------------------
 - Add context menu to switch X/YScale and Grid on/off. Well, the grid can
   currently only switch off, which means it can't be shown without the scale.
 - Add context menu to change the count of indicator windows.


2010-11-20
============
LaunchPad
-----------
 - Stores his configuration now in ~/Filu/ButtonPads/LaunchPad. Therefore you
   have to move your existing LaunchPad.ini file if you has done an update.

PerformerF
------------
 - Add new toolbar to handle IndicatorSets. Works like the LaunchPad,
   Right-Click for a context menu. The button settings are stored in
   ~/Filu/ButtonPads/PerformerIndiSetPad. The settings of the IndicatorSet
   itself is stored as usual in ~/Filu/IndicatorSets. The name of the button
   is used for the IndicatorSet-Name. Deletion of a button will not delete
   the IndicatorSet.


2010-11-18
============
PerformerF
------------
 - Add a "Zoom Out View" as dock widget. The idea is to have a small window
   which give an overview with longer time frame. After start and close of
   PerformerF you will find an indicator settings file "ZoomOutWidget" in
   ~/Filu/IndicatorSets. Here should you set ShowX/YScale to "false". To use an
   indicator of your choice append a "Indicator=YourChoice" line.
 - The icon color of "Group Navi 2" is changed from dark blue to cyan.

PlotSheet/Painter
-------------------
 - Add a percent scale when click or hold down the middle mouse button.


2010-11-15
============
PerformerF
------------
 - Arrange the LaunchPad buttons vertical when the toolbar is left or right.
 - Split the MainToolBar. Each functionality group has now his own toolbar.
 - The toolbar buttons are now movable by Ctrl-LeftMouseBtn.

LaunchPad
-----------
 - Add Tip as key to the ini file to provide a tool tip information.
 - Add context menu. Edit, add and remove buttons with a simple GUI.


2010-11-08
============
ManagerF
----------
 - AddFiPage has now three symbol edit lines, so you can more comfortable add
   new FIs by fill out the fields by hand. You could also add new symbols to an
   existing FI by enter only an existing symbol in 'RefSymbol' (left name/type
   empty) and the new in one the new lines.
 - The upper script launcher/selector is still not very useful. But the "Filu-
   Provider" and the underlying "database" was updated.
 - Save/Restore last used settings. Window position and geometry sadly still not
   handled.
 - Has now a message line at the bottom where some feedback is given. The
   quality of the info need improvements.
 - New page 'Log Book' where are all messages collected for your reference.
 - Some new icons but not as the best. Are you artistic talented?


2010-11-04
============
New Snapshot

2010-05-08
  FClass:     add hasError(), removeErrorText(), clearErrors().
  All Parts:  use new error handling stuff.
  Indicator:  on error behavior optimized, also IndicatorPainter.

2010-05-07
  calc:       remove BOOL and MATH, both is supported by MUP, but much better.
  Indicator:  add constants for days and month names, add WEEK.

2010-05-06
  Trader:     some fixes.
  doc:        review trading-rule-file-format.txt, indicator-file-format.txt,
              hacking-c++.txt.

2010-05-03
  AgentF:     change the daemon stuff code, think its now easier to understand.
              Change the command switches from single - to nothing, it's more
              common.

2010-04-24
  Qt bug:     I have fixed this in the Qt git master source and placed a merge
              request. I'm eager what Nokia will say about this.

2010-04-21
  Gitorious:  I opened an accound there and be hopefully soon online with Filu.

2010-04-14
  faq.txt:    added to doc directory.

2010-04-13
  RcFile:     rename the key FiMiHome to FiluHome and capitalized the subfolders
              of FiluHome. Change the default home from hidden ~/.Filu to ~/Filu
  LaunchPad:  the called program could now take [Market], [MarketId], [FiId],
              [Provider] and of course still [Symbol] (now capitalized) as
              parameter. The launch pad config file has a new settings entry
              AllMarkets=true/false and is now located at ~/Filu/LaunchPads/
              with an .ini suffix. Added doc/launchpad-file-format.txt.

2010-04-11
  All parts:  as 2010-04-07 homework: redundant RcFile stuff removed and code
              reviewed to clear up #include in header files. Try always only to
              use class in the header and place #include in *.cpp.
  FObject:    renamed to FClass. Add a new FObject inherited by QObject similar
              to FWidget by QWidget. Both inherited by FClass. I hope this
              is commonly acceptable and not a design nightmare. FClass has FiMi
              and RcFile as members and both will only used once in a program to
              save resources.

2010-04-08
  RcFile:     changed from good style of coding to use enum as key to bad one
              with string, just because I'm lazy :-/ The benefit is that it is
              more ease to use, more flexible. See entry at 2010-04-07.
  AgentF:     replace QSettings stuff with mRcFile.
  FiMi:       according to 2010-03-20 to drop the independency, it is
              consequently to use here also mRcFile.

2010-04-07
              changed *.pro files. The compiled files will now placed in own
              directories below FiluSource/tmp to avoid pulluting the source
              tree.
  FObject:    Add mRcFile, hope is useful.
              TODO: remove redundant RcFile stuff in all parts.

2010-04-01
  common:     Exporter/Importer handle now most of all data. Now we have a
              backup and restore solution. The speed is not like turbo powered
              when handle 30.000 eod bars but how cares, it works.
              TODO: backtest data stuff.

2010-04-01
  common:     add FObject::check4FiluError(), I hope is useful.
              TODO: review all project code parts to use it.

2010-03-28
  FiMi:       add setSqlParm(). Allows a most flexible way to call any new SQL
              without the need to write a special FiMi function. Works together
              with execSql() which was introduced with InspectorF.cpp. The harm
              is of cause that you must know how the sql looks like, the FiMi
              include file doesn't tell you. And in case of a sql modification
              you don't know which other program parts may affected.

2010-03-27
              clean up Filu/database. Remove old stuff from Christian which I
              never will use. Review the configure script and the *.sql files,
              but they still needs more attention.

2010-03-20
              change the project name from FiMi to Filu. Drop the Idea with a
              universal library without dependencies to the FiMi, sorry, Filu
              programs. Now are all libraries located in sub directories below
              Filu/libs and will build only one library libFilu. Therefore the
              *.pro files was changed, but I'm not quite happy. Needs work.

2010-03-15
  common:     add Exporter.cpp, the counterpart to Importer.cpp.
  agentf:     add "-exp" command, witch use the new Exporter class. Details
              about the command switches are located in doc/export-data.txt.

2010-02-20
  performerf: added a second group navi. Now we can quit simple copy entries
              between groups.

2009-09-07
  calc:       add VIEWNAME(...) and WATCHDOGS(...)

2009-09-05
  graphics:   add the basis for chart objects. To add a chart object chose one
              from the menu in performerf and place it somewhere on the chart.
              Changing and moving are almost as usual apart from that don't hold
              down the left button while moving. Play around and you will see.
              Pressing Del removes an selected CO.
              Available chart objects are right now only "Line".

2009-08-19
  performerf: add a launch pad to the main tool bar which could start any
              application with any parameter list. The tag [symbol] in the
              command line is substituted with a symbol of the current viewing
              FI. To add/change the default button look into ~/.FiMi/LaunchPad.
              I think it's self explained.

2009-08-06
  graphics:   added a data view to IndicatorWidget.cpp. Like the indicator
              picker at the left is this view accessible at the right edge of
              the plotsheet. Just simple move the splitter.

2009-08-03
  graphics:   polished plot code and x-scale plotting.
              Holding down the Ctrl-Key accelerate the scrolling of the chart.

2009-07-28
  calc:       add MUP(<expression>) This calls the muParser library.
              <expression> could be a full complex math expression. For details
              of supported operators and functions see:
              http://muparser.sourceforge.net/mup_features.html#idDef2

2009-07-22
  agentf:     code polished and added some new commands.
              "-daemon" where he read from stdin and execute each command line
              he read until Ctrl+D is pressed. similar to "-rcf".
              "-ps", prints the settings.
              "-imp" takes now also a file name.
              Furthermore he starts now multiple instances to do a big job. e.g.
              at "-full" to download quotes parallel. The amount of instances is
              configurable in the settings file.

2009-07-19
  agentf:     add new command "-addSplit"

2009-07-17
  inspectorf: ...added to progs. It's the backtester with automated rule and
              indicator parameter substitute. Each constant is changeable.
              Edit the constants in the Strategy-Tab encapsulated in braces {}
              in two ways:
              {10;12;14} each of the value is used. No limit of values.
              {10-20 i 2} from 10 to 20 in steps of 2 is used.

2009-07-10
  agentf:     change commands to "-imp" and "-rcf"
  libf:       Importer.cpp now imports split data

2009-07-05
  graphics:   add a second color paint mode to PLOT(CANDLE,...)
              <high>-color is line color if close > prevClose, default green
              <low>-color  is line color if close < prevClose, default red
              <open>-color is body fill color if close > open, default black
              So far no change, but when <close>-color is set then:
              <close>-color is body fill color if close < open

2009-07-04
  calc:       add SIMTRADE(<trading-rule-file-name>), it runs a trading
              simulation and add a lot of variables to the indicator.
              e.g. TotalBalance. Furthermore will the color of OPEN, HIGH, LOW
              CLOSE changed. So PLOT(CANDLE, FI()) visualise the trading.
              For details look doc/trading-rule-file-format.txt

2009-06-18
  calc:       add <bool> = BETWEEN(<lowBorder>, <highBorder>, <foo1>[, <foon>])
              <bool> comes true when each value of foo1-n is in a range of
              lowBorder and highBorder

2009-06-13
  calc:       add SETCOLOR(<variable>, <true-color>, <false-color>)

2009-06-10
  agentf:     change the file format of "-impFi". Details now in
              doc/import-file-format.txt

2009-06-03
              long time is nothing happens with this project because of private
              things. But the world was still turning. Trolltech was bought by
              Nokia. Qt 4.5 was released, and comes with a new "feature". For
              detail look at Qt's Task Tracker ID 237876. So I was forced to
              download the sources of Qt 4.3.5 :-(
              Furthermore don't work fetchFi_yahoo.pl. After googling it seems
              related on changes by yahoo. The perl finance quote have a new
              version 1.16 to fix the problem, but...I didn't got it running :-(

2007-08-01
  diggerf:    uploaded. It's the scanner tool. If the variable "SCAN4" in an
              indicator is greater null the FI will added to the group
              "ScanResults/<indicatorName>"

2007-07-29
  calc:       add <var2> = REF(<var1>, <back-ref-value>)

2007-07-27
  graphics:   add PLOT(DASHLINE, <var>), well...could be improved :-/

2007-07-26
  calc:       add <var> = CROSS(<foo1>, <foo2>, <type>)
              <type> can be: UP, DOWN, BOTH
  performerf: 1st draft uploaded. Use drag&drop to add FIs to groups. Drag FIs
              or groups out to remove them.

2007-07-14
  agentf:     new command "-impFi", reads from stdin
              infos to the expected file format look into
              progs/libf/common/Importer.h

2007-07-12
  calc &      add new indicator key "*AddToGroup=<foo>". When the indicator file
  graphics:   contains somewhere a line with above key, the indicator appears
              in that group in the new indicator picker window lefthand of the
              chart window. Include so much "*AddToGroup=" as you like

2007-07-02
  calc:       add TA-Lib support

2007-06-28
  agentf:     interchange parameter order of "-addFi", <market> and <symbolType>

2007-06-27
  agentf:     add new command "-RCF <fileName>" (Read Command File)
              the file can contain each command supported by agentf

2007-06-24
  graphics:   add y-scale, adjust chart painting - no more fidget at the right
              hand side while density changes, no half painted last candle

2007-06-23
  graphics:   add PLOT(HISTOGRAM, <var>) and PLOT(HISTOGRAMBAR, <var>)
  calc:       add <var> = BOOL(<var1> <operator> <var2>)
                operators are <, >, =, <=, >=, <>, &, |
                as TRUE is all bigger than 0.0 interpreted
                if <boolExp> is TRUE variable is set to 1.0

2007-06-22
  graphics:   add PLOT(CANDLE, FI())
                  PLOT(CANDLE, <open>, <high>, <low>, <close>, <volume>)
                  <volume> is not used currently
              <high>-color is line color if close > prevClose, default green
              <low>-color  is line color if close < prevClose, default red
              <open>-color is body fill color if win-day, default black
                           if it's a lost-day, line color is used as fill color

2007-06-21
  db:         new table msymbol, holds provider specific symbols to markets
  libFiMiQt4:
  & agentf:   use new table msymbol. provider scripts are now supplied with his
              own market symbols...if some are defined

              existing and coming progs
  managerf:   added to CVS tree. actual doesn't do any job, but includes a chart
              window which is later used by performerf which will be the
              Qtstalker substitute

2007-06-06

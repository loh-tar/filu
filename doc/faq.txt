Here you find answers about questions you may never would like to know, answers
why something is done as it is done and some known issues.


Usability
===========
Q: How can I export data from Filu?
A: Exporting data from Filu is currently not as much supported. Till now I
   didn't have a need for e.g exporting indicator data, but my considerations
about that tend to an AgentF command which print out a table to stdout or into a
file. Technically should it not to be as hard. What nicely works is exporting
static data out of the database. For details see doc/export-data.txt.

Q: Which other platforms than Ubuntu and Arch Linux are supported?
A: I can't say it for sure, but it should run on all Unix like systems with some
   CMakeLists.txt modifications. If you are an experienced BSD, OSX, SUSE,
Red Hat, what-ever-Linux user and got it running let me know how we can put all
under one hood. I think it will not run on Windows, but if you got it, let me
know too.


Miscellaneous
===============
Q: What does Filu mean?
A: In short: I don't know.
   In long: Filu was born around April 2007 as FiMi and was inspired by
Christian Kindler. FiMi stands for Financial Instrument management Interface.
After the break with Christian, someone in 2007, I developed apart from the
public and was looking for a new name. Most of my ideas was already taken by
other projects. In March 2010, I was intended to go back to the daylight, I
found while searching for a new name Filou. Filou is described in a German
dictionary as a fellow like a chiseler/crook but also as a
scapegrace/good-for-nothing. Perfect! I discard the o because its still sounds
the same (the i sounds like the e in "me") and have something like the original
name with Fi for finance/finance-instrument and lu could be stand for Linux
utilities.

Q: Why are you using Postgres?
A: Postgres was a suggestion by database professional Christian. An option was
   Oracle but that was to special and to less OSS driven to me. MySQL has not as
that features which Christian has planed to use. I don't know if the current
Filu status would be portable to MySQL or not, nor if all planed features would
be possible with MySQL. Anyway, I like Postgres and believe its the better DB
than the most popular MySQL.

Q: Why are you using muParser and not QtScript as math parser?
A: I understood too late that it could be a possibility for my purposes. And
   maybe it could be used as whole indicator concept. But I'm not unlucky with
the current status.

Q: Why do you not using KDE libraries?
A: Sometimes I ask me if I should use it. But it would make the project less
   portable and the benefit is questionable.

Q: I'm an expert of <foo>. Did you know that your source code lacks of some
   essential rules and you do some things more complicate as needed?
A: I'm not an expert and struggle me each day again with many things. I would me
   pleased to learn from your advice.

Q: I read somewhere in the docs about Qtstalker, and PerformerF looks
   similar to that. Why do you not contribute Qtstalker but start a new project?
A: In 2006/7 I was impressed by Steve's Qtstalker and after a while I began to
   make suggestions. Steve implement some of these. A little time later I start
to send patches with modifications. Because I was not as happy with the evolved
source code my patches going bigger. But this drive Steve not as happy and
rejected at somehow point my patches. Also my suggestion to switch from Qt3 to
Qt4. At this time come Christian to me with his own ideas about FiMi and a
Qtstalker interface to that. After some experiments and my experiences not to be
the boss I start from scratch with Qt4.

Q: You break with Steve, you break with Christian. Are you not a team player?
A: A team has one goal where each player is fighting for. Christian was not as
   much interested to get a substitute for Qtstalker than to get an universal
library preferably usable with Perl, which was not my primary goal and ask too
much of my C++ skills. Furthermore he changed many times the database
structure to get some of his ideas working, but that makes me unlucky. I hope
these kind of trouble can be avoid by using git at Gitorious.org where everybody
is his own boss.


Known Issues
==============
Mouse moves in the upper left corner of the plot sheet are not recognized.
There will no QEvent received. No idea what could be wrong, you?


Technical Details
===================
Q: Why the quality column in some data tables?
A: To avoid unwanted changes by a script. Only to decide by e.g. the date if a
   eodBar is final is not enough. If you have repaired some wrong data by hand
will these fixes be lost when you run an data update again.

Q: Why is it not possible to store two FIs with the same name but a different
   type?
A: Um....It makes DB-insert functions much less complicate and a small suffix
   in the name to make them different is also for the user not as bad.

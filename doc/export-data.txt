export call may look like these:

  agentf exp --group MyFavorites --fiNames

=======
Afterwards manual modification of the exported data could done like these:

Rename something

Delete something
  sed '/yahoo/d' expData.imp > expDataModified.imp

You could also using a pipe
  agentf exp --all --verbose 1 | sed 's/yahoo/Yahoo/g' > expDataModified.imp

Config File Keys
==================
If you need different settings as the defaults (listed below), you can modify
some by create a system wide config file /etc/xdg/Filu.conf or an user config
file ~/.config/Filu.conf with contents like these in the [General] section. The
other sections are not as interesting to change because they are updated by the
progs at run time.

FiluHome=~/Filu
  The location where Filu stores your personal data and settings, but none of the
  DB data. It's usual to store such data in ~/.foo but I don't like that hidden
  files/directories with interesting data.

IndicatorPath=FiluHome/Indicators/
  Where your self written, or shipped by Filu, indicators are located. These
  indicators which are used to paint, scan or trade, but no FiluPowerIndicators.

IndiSetsPath=FiluHome/IndicatorSets/
  A indicator set is a combination of indicators shown at once by PerformerF.

TradingRulePath=FiluHome/TradingRules/
  Where your trading rules are located.

IndiFilterSetPath=FiluHome/IndicatorFilterSettings/
  A filter set stores which data are not shown in the indicator data view, at the
  right of an indicator chart window.

InstallPath=/usr/local/lib/Filu/
  Changing these affect only where Filu searches for some data at first time
  start up.

LogFile=FiluHome/filu.log
  Where error/info messages are logged.

ProviderPath=InstallPath/provider/
  Where the provider scripts are located.

SqlPath=/usr/local/lib/Filu/sqls/
  Where SQLs are stored to access the DB.

DatabaseName=filu
HostName=localhost
HostPort=5432
FiluSchema=filu
Password=filu
UserName=filu
  Which database is to use and how could it be accessed. Yes, Password in clear text
  looks like that there could things improved.

CommitBlockSize=500
  How many data rows will be send to the server before they will committed. Sadly
  has these settings no effect because of broken Qt Driver.

DaysToFetchIfNoData=365
  How many bars, in days, should be downloaded the first time.

MakeNameNice=true
  When importing data will FiNames are stripped, or not.

MaxClones=5
  How many AgentFs will be started to do a big job, e.g at 'full'.

VerboseLevel=Info
  How many info while running an application will be printed. Possible values
  are Quiet, Info, Ample and Max or 0/1/2/3. The names are not case sensitive.

SqlDebugLevel=Quiet
  How many infos by the DB access will be printed while running. Same possible
  values as VerboseLevel has.

Config File Keys
==================
If you need different settings as the defaults (listed below), you can modify
some by edit the system wide config file /etc/xdg/Filu.conf or the user config
file ~/.config/Filu.conf with contents like these in the [General] section. The
other sections are not as interesting to change because they are updated by the
progs at run time.

The templates files used at install are doc/systemwide-config-file.conf and
doc/user-config-file.conf. So you can modify these too if needed.

Keys which represent a path or an URL/file can contain the tilde sign ~ or other
path keys leaded by a dollar sign $. You will guess right now, the tilde is
replaced by the user home path and the dollar marked key is substituted by the
the value of the key.

Devil=
  The Devil key is for devil-opers ;-) It's used as appendix to the Filu schema
  and user schema of the data base and as sub directory name below Hell.
  The only recommended way to change the Devil value is to use 'sum' and 'exo'
  commands.

DocPath=$InstallPrefix/share/doc/Filu
  Where the documentation of Filu is located.

FiluHome=~/Filu
  The location where Filu stores your personal data and settings, but none of the
  DB data. It's usual to store such data in ~/.foo but I don't like that hidden
  files/directories with interesting data.

Hell=~/FiluDevil
  It's the devil home ;-) FiluHome is set to Hell/Devil at 'sum' command when
  called without --cpc.

ImportPath=$FiluHome/ImpFiles
  Where AgentFs 'imp' command also search for import files.

IndicatorPath=$FiluHome/Indicators
  Where your self written, or shipped by Filu, indicators are located. These
  indicators which are used to paint, scan or trade, but no FiluPowerIndicators.

IndiSetsPath=$FiluHome/IndicatorSets
  An indicator set is a combination of indicators shown at once by PerformerF.

IndiFilterSetPath=$FiluHome/IndicatorFilterSettings
  A filter set stores which data are not shown in the indicator data view, at the
  right of an indicator chart window.

InstallPrefix=@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@
  It's set by CMake at install time. So you should never touch that key.

InstallPath=$InstallPrefix/lib/Filu
  Currently is all stuff stored below these path, except of course the DB data
  and the system wide config file.

LogFile=$FiluHome/filu.log
  Where error/info messages are logged.

PluginPath=$InstallPath
  Where plugins will be searched. Currently only the fixed Postgres driver is
  used and must be copied to PluginPath/sqldrivers.

ProviderPath=$InstallPath/provider
  Where the provider scripts are located.

SqlPath=$InstallPrefix/lib/Filu/sqls
  Where SQLs are stored to access the DB.

TradingRulePath=$FiluHome/TradingRules
  Where your trading rules are located.

DatabaseName=filu
HostName=localhost
HostPort=5432
Password=filu
PgUserRole=filu
  Which database is to use and how could it be accessed. Yes, Password in clear
  text looks like that there could be things improved.

CommitBlockSize=500
  How many data rows will be send to the server before they will committed.
  Sadly has these settings no effect because of broken Qt Driver.

DaysToFetchIfNoData=730
  How many bars, in days, should be downloaded the first time.

DeleteDevilConfig=false
  When true will AgentFs exo command delete the devil config file without the
  need to give --del-omen.

MakeNameNice=true
  When importing data will FiNames are stripped, or not.
  See also doc/make-name-nice.conf.

MaxClones=5
  How many AgentFs will be started to do a big job, e.g at 'full'.

MaxTimeLag=600
  The time where we become impatient and start one more clone,
  delay in milliseconds.

MinTimeLag=200
  Don't ask the provider too rapidly, delay in milliseconds.

MinJobsPerClone=3
  The minimum count of jobs left per clone to start a new clone.

Verbose=Info
  How many info while running an application will be printed. Possible values
  are Quiet, Info, Ample and Max or 0/1/2/3. The names are not case sensitive.

SqlDebug=Info
  How many infos by the DB access will be printed while running. Same possible
  values as Verbose has.

Qt Bug in PSql Driver
=======================
Preamble
----------
The shipped driver in the lib directory was created by the here described
procedure. It is included to the Filu source tree for your convenience. If it
not work try to download and install yourself. Good luck!


The Pest
----------
In Qt later 4.3.5 (released May 2008) is an ugly bug in the PSql driver which is
sadly still not fixed. Moreover it would seem that there is no plan fix it :-(

Pest Control
--------------
As dirty workaround we have to do these steps:

Download and unzip qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.5.tar.gz from
  http://qt-project.org/downloads

NOTE: If your distribution uses a newer or older version of Qt, it might be wise
      to download the suitable qt-source. The source tree may also looks
different, so you have to look for the appropriate files. In case of a newer
version it is of cause possible that the bug is fixed and here is nothing to do.

Edit the file
  qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.5/src/sql/drivers/psql/qsql_psql.cpp

Search for this code block and comment out the with "case PreparedQueries"
that it looks as below:
  bool QPSQLDriver::hasFeature(DriverFeature f) const
  {
      switch (f) {
      case Transactions:
      case QuerySize:
      case LastInsertId:
      case LowPrecisionNumbers:
      case EventNotifications:
          return true;
  //    case PreparedQueries:
      case PositionalPlaceholders:
          return d->pro >= QPSQLDriver::Version82;
      case BatchOperations:

That will cause a warning when compiling in the next step which is OK. Now open
a terminal and cd into the extracted qt source tree.

  cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.4/src/plugins/sqldrivers/psql


Arch
------
  qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/include/libpq/" "LIBS+=-L/usr/lib -lpq" psql.pro
  make


Ubuntu
--------
Thanks to Thomas for reporting, tested with Kubuntu 10.04.
You need an additional .deb package:
  libpq-dev

  qmake -o Makefile "INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/include/postgresql" "LIBS+=-L/usr/lib -lpq" psql.pro
  make


Finish
--------
Copy the compiled driver into a directory 'sqldrivers' *below* the Filu
PluginPath, see doc/config-file.txt. The exact directory name is mandatory!
I suggest:

  sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/Filu/sqldrivers
  sudo cp libqsqlpsql.so /usr/local/lib/Filu/sqldrivers/

Here you find information about the indicator file format and which functions
are be supported. When here in front of a line, or in the description, a minus
sign appears is these function, or part, probably not implemented. It's more a
draft, an idea. Maybe not the best idea or meanwhile obsolete.

Indicator files, or short Indicators, are plain text files and be the linchpin
to got any desired result, if only to paint a line or to do pretty complicated
trading ideas. Well, the latter need one more file, see
doc/trading-rule-file-format.txt. Indicators are located by default in
~/Filu/Indicators and could created using ManagerFs Indicator Page or with your
favourite text editor.


Remarks, Embedded Setting Keys
================================
*
  Lines beginning with an asterisk "*" are ignored by the indicator but will
  investigate by other program parts. They look here for embedded setting keys.
  Spaces within the settings line are allowed. After the key follow usually a
  separator character e.g. a colon ":". The asterisk is part of the key so you
  can disable a setting temporary when you include a second asterisk or any
  other character like "-".

*AddToGroup:<Foo>[, <Foo>...]
  The indicator will appear in the group <Foo> in the indicator picker. If the
  group not exist will they created. Include so much "*AddToGroup:<Foo>" as you
  like.

*ScanFreq:<Frame>
  <Frame> could be Day, Week, Month, Quarter or any positive number. The names
  are not case sensitive. The indicator will automatic used as scanner. But this
  need also a declared SCAN4 variable, otherwise an error is thrown.


Reseved Names, Special Variables And Defines
==============================================
[<FiAlias>.]OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME, OPINT, BID, ASK, BIDVOL, ASKVOL
  If no <FiAlias> is given, the currend FI is used.
    OPEN
    foo.CLOSE
  NOTE: "THIS" is the <FiAlias> of the currend FI.

SCAN4
  The scanner look for them to decide if an event is happen. Each value greater
  null is an event.

    SCAN4 = CROSS(CLOSE, sma200)
    SCAN4 = MUP(foo < bar)

FI([<FiAlias>])
  Useable as parameter in some cases, represent the full eodBar data set.
  If no <FiAlias> is given, the currend FI is used.

DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR
  Keep the number of...
  1 = Monday, January
  The week number is in accordance to ISO 8601.

  exit = MUP(DAY == 4)

MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN
JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC
  These are constants and will replaced by the number of...
  1 = MON, JAN

  exit = MUP(DAY == THU)

WATCHDOGn, WATCHDOGRESULTn
  Whereas n is a number. These variables are calculated by WATCHDOGS().
  WATCHDOGn holds the calculated line data and WATCHDOGRESULTn if the line was
  crossed. But you should never (need to) use these variables. They only exist
  if a dog is on patrol.


Commands
==========
-DEF(<Alias>, <Value>)
  Defines a constant with given value. The alias could used at any position in
  the indicator file and will replaced with value. Whereas value does not have
  to be a number.

    DEF(pi, 3.1415926)

-DEFCALL(<Variable>=<Default>[, <Variable>=<Default>...])
  Defines together with RETURN() the function call of this indicator.
  See also CALL and RETURN.

INCLUDE(<IndicatorName>[, IGNOREPLOT])
  Include the given indicator file and ignore any plot stuff located in that
  file when IGNOREPLOT is given.

INCLTALIB(<Type>, <Parameter>[, <Parameter>...])
  <Type> is any type provided by ta-lib.
  Generates variables, plus the SETCOLOR() and PLOT() statements.

    INCLTALIB(BBANDS, CLOSE)
    INCLTALIB(SMA, 200, CLOSE)

-LOADFI(<Symbol>, <Market>, <AsFiAlias>)
  Produce the variables <FiAlias>.OPEN <FiAlias>.HIGH ...

    LOADFI(AAPL, NYSE, apple)

-LOADCOS(<FiAlias>)
  Load the Chart Objects of the given FI.
  The COs of the currend FI are automatic loaded.

-LOADQUOTES(<FiAlias>)
  Load the Quotes to the given FI. If no <FiAlias> is given the currend FI
  is used. Produce the variables <FiAlias>.BID, <FiAlias>.ASK,
  <FiAlias>.BIDVOL, <FiAlias>.ASKVOL

PRIMARY(<Variable>)
  The primary variable is used to place the cursor on the y-scale. When no
  primary variable is set, CLOSE, VOLUME or the first plottet variable is used.

-RETURN(<Variable>[, <Variable2>...])
  Declares which variables will be returned when this indicator is called as
  function by another indicator. See also CALL and DEFCALL.

SIMTRADE(<TradingRuleName>)
  This includes all variables produced by the indicator used by the trading
  rule and some status variables calculated while the trading simulation. For
  a list of variables see doc/trading-rule-file-format.txt

    SIMTRADE(SimpleRule)

VIEWNAME(<Name>)
  This give the indicator an alias name. Chart Objects are assigned to this
  view name. If no "VIEWNAME()" is included in the indicator file, the name of
  the indicator file is used instead.
  NOTE: VIEWNAME() will currently ignored when located in an included file by
        INCLUDE() command. I'm unsure if that should be changed.

    VIEWNAME(Main)


Plot Commands
===============
The command for plot something look like:

  PLOT(<Type>, <Parameter>[, <Parameter>...])

<Type> can be: -BAR, -BOOLBOARD, CANDLE, -CO, -DOT, HISTOGRAM, HISTOGRAMBAR,
               -LABELS, LINE

-PLOT(BOOLBOARD, <Variable>[, <Variable2>...][, LABELS])
  Plots a kind of table with dots which indicates if <VariableN> is true.
  When the last parameter is LABELS will at the left side the label of each
  variable plotted.

PLOT(CANDLE, FI())
PLOT(CANDLE, FI(<Alias>))
PLOT(CANDLE, <Open>, <High>, <Low>, <Close>, <Volume>)
  Yes, plots candels. The color of the candles can be changed by setting the
  colors of the variables.
  <High> -color is line color if close > prevClose, default green
  <Low>  -color is line color if close < prevClose, default red
  <Open> -color is body fill color if close > open, default black, but
  <Close>-color is body fill color if close < open, only when <Close>-color
  was set.

-PLOT(CO, <ViewName>[, <CoType>[, <FiAlias>]])
  Plots the Chart Objects assigned to <ViewName>.
  If no <CoType> is given, all Chart Objects are plotted.
  <CoType> are: ALL, ARROW, LINE
  The Chart Objects of the currend FI/VIEWNAME will automatic plotted.

-PLOT(LABELS[, <Direction>[, <Position>]])
  Plots the labels with values
  <Direction> are: V, H
  <Position> are: TL, TB, TM, T, B, M
  Default is H,TL and can be changed in RcFile

    PLOT(LABELS, V, M)

PLOT(LINE, <Foo>)

  PLOT(LINE, CLOSE)


Set Commands
==============
FIXME: None of these are implemented, but they should replace the existing
       functions with the same name, because it looks more logical.

SETCOLOR(<Variable>, <Color>)
  <Color> could be one of these names:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords
  ...or given as RGB in hex with a leading #.
  NOTE: Color names are not case sensitive.

    SETCOLOR(foo, BluE)
    SETCOLOR(foo, #0000Ff) // the same blue

SETCOLOR(<Variable1>, <Variable2>, <TrueColor>, <FalseColor>)
  <Variable2> is interpretet as TRUE if value is greater null

    SETCOLOR(VOLUME, winDay, green, red)

SETLABEL(<Variable>[, <Label>])
  Change the default/automatic generated label.
  If no <Label> is given, the label is ereased. Than will the line be plotted
  but no label with value

    SETLABEL(closeSma200, sma200)


Functions
===========
-ALIAS(<Variable>)
  Generate an alias for the variable, this cost no more memory or calculation
  time. This could be useful if you like to use an automatic generated variable
  by an INCLTALIB() command.

    foo2 = ALIAS(foo)

-CALL(<IndicatorName>, <Variable>[, <Variable2>...])
  Calls the noted indicator with given variables as parameter.
  See also DEFCALL and RETURN.

    foo2 = CALL(FuncIndi, foo)
    foo3, foo4 = CALL(FuncIndi2, foo)

-COUNTER(<StartTrig>, <StopTrig>, <ResetTrig>)

CROSS(<Variable>, <Threshold>[, <Type>])
  <Type> are: UP, DOWN, BOTH
  If <Type> is not set, BOTH is used

    foo = CROSS(foo1, foo2)

FILU(<Function>[, <Parameter>...])
  This calls the "Filu Power Indicators".
  <Function> is any function provided by Filu. <Parameter> and parameter count
  depends on <Function>. Currently exist only one indicator. Feel free to create
  new stuff as described in doc/hacking-filu-power-indicators.txt.

    ccp = FILU(CCP, FI())

  Calls the Component Counter Percentage, which look at all underlyings from a
  FI and add up if they have a winday(+1) or a lostday(-1) and returns the
  result as percentage value.

MUP(<Expression>)
  <Expression> could be a full complex math or bool expression. For details
  of supported operators and functions see the documentation of muParser.

    midPrice = MUP((HIGH + LOW ) / 2)
    signal = MUP((foo1 < foo2) and (foo3 xor (foo4 > foo5)))

-PERF(<EntTrig>, <EntVal>, <EntDelay>, <ExitTrig>, <ExitVal>, <ExitDelay>)
  Calculate the performance

REF(<Variable>, <RefVal>)
  Delivers the value from <Variable> <RefVal>-days back if <RefVal> is
  negative, or ahead if <RefVal> positive.
  Well, it's of course your job that you only forecast values that makes sense.
  The CLOSE should not fit these condition but lunar phases, hollidays,
  dividend pay days, splits or what ever.

    foo = REF(sma20, -4) FIXME: only back ref is supported

SETCOLOR(<Color>)
  <Color> could be one of these names...
  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#ColorKeywords
  ...or given as RGB in hex with a leading #.
  NOTE: Color names are not case sensitive.

    foo = SETCOLOR(BluE)
    foo = SETCOLOR(#0000Ff) // the same blue

SETCOLOR(<Variable>, <TrueColor>, <FalseColor>)
  <Variable> is interpretet as TRUE if its value is greater null.

    foo = SETCOLOR(foo2, RED, GREEN)
    foo = SETCOLOR(foo2, #35ef20, GREEN)

-SETLABEL([<Label>])
  Change the default/automatic generated label.
  If no <Label> is given, the label is ereased. Than will the line be plotted
  but no label with value.

    CLOSE.SMA200 = SETLABEL(sma200)

TALIB(<Function>[, <Parameter>...])
  <Function> is any function provided by TA-Lib. <Parameter> and parameter
  count depends on <Function>. For a list of all TA-Lib functions see:
  http://ta-lib.org/function.html
  Forthermore shows ManagerFs indicator page all details and provide handy
  buttons to use them. If something is cloudy with the TA-Lib descriptions
  showing at ManagerF, don't ask me! All these infos are read out of the
  library. So consult the TA-Lib documentation.

    fooSma200 = TALIB(SMA, foo, TimePeriod=200)

WATCHDOGS(<ViewName>[, <ViewName>...])
  Call the watch dogs assigned to the current FI and the listet views. Watch
  Dogs are special marked CO lines. If the reference variable listed in the CO
  cross the CO line in any direction comes the result TRUE.
  NOTE: Only one watchdog call is supported per indicator.

    burglar = WATCHDOGS(Main)

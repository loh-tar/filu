Priority
==========
H: high
M: medium
L: low

The priority of things todo are quite arbitrary chosen and may not guaranty
that things are done in this order not even that they ever be done.

You are kindly invited to take one of these points to start your contribution.
But you could of cause chose any other, not here listed, issue if you like.


All Parts
===========
H: finish cmake build system. I think there need some modifications in use of
   variables
H: add dbus support to the progs. Send messages whats going on and react on such
   message, e.g. agentf."FI updated" -> performerf "ah, reload chart"
L: replace all text what the user could read with tr(...) so that localised
   versions are possible
L: create and use fancy Icons in the user interfaces. But do it conform with
   rules from freedesktop.org, see:
   http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/latest/ar01s05.html
   maybe will these useful: http://gitorious.org/q-xdg


Filu/Database
===============
H: Handle "quality" field in trigger and/or insert functions.
H: adjust the eodBar data on the fly from dividends
M: write new GetSymbols.sql, now is too complicate an delivers not ever what
   expected.
M: add automatic new added FIs to the users FI group "New FIs". But that need a
   merge of Filu and FiluU.
M: Create the main DB like the user tables => No need to use the console, let it
   do ManagerF.
L: figure out optimum postgres parameters.
L: list all markets a specific provider provides (?)


AgentF
========
M: print more precise info when something goes wrong.


PerformerF
============
H: add a shortcut to display/hide the toolbar, now you can disable the tb with
   right-click by the mouse, but how you can bring them back?
M: Fix search FI widget to set cursor inside when aktivated
M: Rename ZoomOutWidget to ZoomWidget
M: improve drag&drop. when drop an index to the group list of the navi, create
   a group and insert all underlyings (hm, maybe it's the best *not* to insert
   the underlyings but include them on the fly when group is selected)
M: add an "about" button with copyright and other stuff
L: add buttons to change the density quickly. Since the new IndiSetPad might
   this no longer needed.
L: Add spin boxes to set the to be loaded date range


ManagerF
==========
M: make data at FI page editable.
M: add a split browse table to FI page, editable of course.
M: add the possibility to define action(scripts) which will executed after an
   event. e.g. a new FI was added: download quotes. Or search for more info
   about the FI on the inet like full name, more symbols etc...
L: add syntax highlightning to indicator editor
L: add picker menu for available functions/commands like for TA-LIB. This means
   PLOTFOO, SETFOO, CROSS etc. and, more important, also FiluPower-Indicators
   usable with CalcFilu. But that needs concept work...
L: add a help page to display all (or most) available docu, copyright and other
   stuff


Libf
======
H: merge Filu.cpp and FiluU.cpp to Filu.cpp
M: new class CmdOptions, see FTool.h
M: redesign FiGroupWidget signals/slots. use QModelIndex for slots and
   QHash<QString, QString> for signals. (hmm...)
L: short selling in Trader.cpp.


LaunchPad
===========
L: add icons. Make icon/text optional showing.
L: add as option that buttons turns 90Â° when tool bar is placed left or right


PlotSheet/Painter
===================
M: rethink MyMouseEvent. Use QVariant or a union to be more flexible. Rename to
   MyEvent or MyMessage
L: logarithmic Y-Scaling


Indicator
===========
H: fix parsing, MUP() doesn't got operators 'or'/'and'. Since when??? I'm sure
   that has worked.
M: change the parsing, split it just after the reading from file into parts
   with the algorithm used at function parsing. Include the original line number
   of the indicator file as first parameter given to CalcFoo to improve error
   messages.
M  change SETFOO as noted in indicator-file-format.txt
M: auto detect math expressions, that is no need to write every time "MUP"
M: change PLOT(CANDLE,FI()) to PLOT(CANDLE) (auto detect FI())
M: fix LOADFI(...)
L: REF(...) fix to the possibility with forecasts.


IndicatorPicker
=================
H: possibility to reload available indicator list, automatic would be the best
M: auto-detect if an indicator was edited, reload then (emit signal to..)
M: restore/mark the used indicator after program start
L: change from treeview to "something better"


Trader
========
M: Change QList<QStringList> mOrders to QList<QHash<QString, QString>> or create a
   special struct for one order


Depots
========
M: Print nice summary report. After all checks are done, select from order table all
   orders newer than "today".
M: Print a progressbar while checking, force Trader to print nothing in that case.


Exporter
==========
H: When export, don't print NoMarket at -markets, market_insert.sql expect
   Reuters as symbol
H: add shortcut command(s) like --full, --userdata, --fullNoBars


Importer
==========
H: add [Include]
M: add [Skip], follow data will ignored until [UnSkip] or [Piks] ?
M: add [Ignore]foo=bar, will ignore all data where key 'foo' has value 'bar'

Priority
==========
H: high
M: medium
L: low

The priority of things todo are quite arbitrary chosen and may not guaranty
that things are done in this order not even that they ever be done.

You are kindly invited to take one of these points to start your contribution.
But you could of cause chose any other, not here listed, issue if you like.


All Parts
===========
H: finish cmake build system. I think there need some modifications in use of
   variables
H: add dbus support to the progs. Send messages whats going on and react on such
   message, e.g. agentf."FI updated" -> performerf "ah, reload chart"
L: replace all text what the user could read with tr(...) so that localised
   versions are possible
L: create and use fancy Icons in the user interfaces. But do it conform with
   rules from freedesktop.org, see:
   http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/latest/ar01s05.html
   maybe will these useful: http://gitorious.org/q-xdg


Filu/Database
===============
H: Review currencys. They need a own market Curry, don't use NoMarket. See also
   gfi_xcurrency_eodbar, it seems I have it not finished.
H: Handle "quality" field in trigger and/or insert functions.
H: adjust the eodBar data on the fly from dividends
M: Think about a function lovelysymbol to replace the view. The function can
   take a prefered symbol type to return. When not found returns as usual the
   symbol with the lowest seq(uence).
M: Add a diary where you can record your thoughts and feelings. These entrys
   should then be viewable in the chart like chartobjects.
M: write new GetSymbols.sql, now is too complicate an delivers not ever what
   expected.
L: Oops, the Password setting take no effekt. I guess it is the consequence of
   the "trust" setting in /etc/postgresql/.../pg_hba.conf
L: figure out optimum postgres parameters.
L: list all markets a specific provider provides (?)


AgentF
========
M: print more precise info when something goes wrong.
M: Add missing filu --foo switches


InspectorF
============
Needs a review/rethink.
- The complete strategy hash looks overkilled, are 6 char not enough?
- Build the hash only out of realy important parts. Remove things like
  used group. Is it possible to replace variable names with normalized names?
- StrategyEditor.cpp looks poor. Rename to something else and use the name for
  a true editor with load/save, maybe at ManagerF. Reformat the rule file nicely
  when loaded
- Rethink the rule format. I guess it would be nicer split a rule over several
  lines, but thats a Trader issue
- Merge 'Last Results', 'Best Foo' tabs into the 'Detail' tab so that detail is
  always visible and changes when one of the other one is clicked.


BackTester
============
M: Change the way how 'Serial Test' works. Now is one strategy build and then
   each FI tested. But fetching bars out of the DB is much more expensive than
   rebuid and/or recalculate an indicator. That should result in nice
   performance improvement when testing many combinations and/or FIs.
L: Use somehow 'Complex Test' from depots simtrade.


PerformerF
============
H: add a shortcut to display/hide the toolbar, now you can disable the tb with
   right-click by the mouse, but how you can bring them back?
M: add an "about" button with copyright and other stuff
L: Fix SearchFi widget to set cursor inside when aktivated and show all FI.
   Hm, it seems that's an issue with the DockWidget, when shown got it not the
   focus.
L: add buttons to change the density quickly. Since the new IndiSetPad might
   this no longer needed.
L: Add spin boxes to set the to be loaded date range


ManagerF
==========
M: make data at FI page editable.
M: add a split browse table to FI page, editable of course.
M: add the possibility to define action(scripts) which will executed after an
   event. e.g. a new FI was added: download quotes. Or search for more info
   about the FI on the inet like full name, more symbols etc...
L: add left from the editor a IndicatorPicker and above of him a list of last
   saved files. Both tilled by a horizontal splitter.
L: Add a simple 'version control system' to the editor page. Means, copy each
   file into a special subfolder and append a timestamp suffix. Add a button
   to bring up a combobox (or use the existing) where you can scroll thru the
   history of the current loaded file and restore the file if desired.
L: add syntax highlightning to indicator editor
L: add picker menu for available functions/commands like for TA-LIB. This means
   PLOTFOO, SETFOO, CROSS etc. and, more important, also FiluPower-Indicators
   usable with CalcFilu. But that needs concept work...
L: add a help page to display all (or most) available docu, copyright and other
   stuff


Libf
======


GroupNavi
===========
H: Add "OnTheFly" group(s).
/Auto Hold automatically selected FIs, not stored, no possibility to add some by
drag&drop. Each group below /Auto use a SQL AutoGroup_<name>.sql and
AutoGroupChild_<name>.sql. The former is used twice. First of cause is it the
content of the group, the FIs. But when you click into the group it is used as
child groups. But clicking into is only possible if there exist a SQL
AutoGroupChild_* which than can select the content (FIs) of the child group.

/Auto/Indexes
  Use AutoGroup_Indexes.sql, select all FIs where type=index.
/Auto/Indexes/<foo>
  Use AutoGroupChild_Indexes.sql, select content e.g when "DAX" is klicked.
/Auto/NewFIs
  Use AutoGroup_NewFIs.sql, select last 10 or 20 FIs order by FiId DESC.

M: redesign FiGroupWidget signals/slots. use QModelIndex for slots and
   QHash<QString, QString> for signals. (hmm...)


LaunchPad
===========
L: add icons. Make icon/text optional showing.
L: add as option that buttons turns 90Â° when tool bar is placed left or right


PlotSheet/Painter
===================
M: rethink MyMouseEvent. Use QVariant or a union to be more flexible. Rename to
   MyEvent or MyMessage
L: logarithmic Y-Scaling


Indicator
===========
M: change the parsing, split it just after the reading from file into parts
   with the algorithm used at function parsing. Include the original line number
   of the indicator file as first parameter given to CalcFoo to improve error
   messages.
M  change SETFOO as noted in indicator-file-format.txt
M: auto detect math expressions, that is no need to write every time "MUP"
M: change PLOT(CANDLE,FI()) to PLOT(CANDLE) (auto detect FI())
M: fix LOADFI(...)
L: REF(...) fix to the possibility with forecasts.


IndicatorPicker
=================
L: change from treeview to "something better"


Trader
========
M: Change QList<QStringList> mOrders to QList<QHash<QString, QString>> or create a
   special struct for one order
L: short selling.


Depots
========
M: Print nice summary report. After all checks are done, select from order table all
   orders newer than "today".
M: Print a progressbar while checking, force Trader to print nothing in that case.


Exporter
==========
H: depot stuff
H: market_insert.sql expect Reuters as symbol (what?)
L: don't print NoMarket at --markets


Importer
==========
H: add [Include]
M: add [Skip], follow data will ignored until [UnSkip] or [Piks] ?
M: add [Ignore]foo=bar, will ignore all data where key 'foo' has value 'bar'

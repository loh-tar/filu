      not very comfortable to use.

1- Approach
=============
Depots in Filu are working with a trading rule. For different trading approaches
you have to create different depots. Each depot has a name and an owner which is
not your Linux login name. You can choose any owner you like e.g. 'Me' or
'Grandpa'. Therefore we could say that Filu is multi-tenancy capable. The depot
name may represent your trading strategy. As in real life has a depot a clearing
account and therefore a currency.

When your account currency is different from the market where you place your
order Filu will note the exchange rate. Therefore you must have the currency
data available. NOTE: IIRC there was something buggy :-/

Let's assume your depots are set up nicely. After an update of eodbar data you
can check all depots if any action is needed. Just by running

  agentf depots --check

At the end will be a list with orders printed with suggestions by your trading
rule what to buy or sell. These list could you print again by running

   agentf depots --lso

One suggestion (notice the 'Advice') may looks like:

  All orders for depot: TestDepot, Id: 1, Value: 12.915,44 USD, AvCash: 8.982,44 USD, Positions: 1
  2011-07-22  Sell    10x US0378331005 Apple Inc.      393.30 USD    Advice    Gain > 20

When you trust your rule, place that order as usual at your broker and inform
Filu that we have now an active order.

  agentf add order 2011-07-22 2011-07-29 AAPL NYSE 10 393.30 Sell Active "Gain > 20" --dp 1

In the next days will Filu track if the order was executed and if yes updates
the account and depot. To list the actual depot situation run

  agentf depots --lsd

  All positions for depot: TestDepot, Id: 1, Value: 12.915,44 USD, AvCash: 8.982,44 USD, Positions: 1
  2009-03-19 Apple Inc.                US0378331005    10  101,60 287%  3.933,00  30%

There you can see last buy/sell date, name and symbol, pieces, last self traded price,
performance, actual value and depot portion.


2- Create a depot step by step
================================
Create the depot:

agentf add broker MyBank "5.95 + OV * 0.001"
agentf add depot TestDepot Me SimpleRule USD MyBank

Add an existing position to the depot:

  agentf add depotPos 2009-03-19 AAPL NYSE 10 101.60 "Sadly only fake data" --dp TestDepot Me

Transfer money to the depot account:

  agentf add post 2011-07-22 CashIn "Our fake chance" 8000 --dp TestDepot Me

Place an order:

  agentf add order 2011-02-28 2011-12-31 AAPL NYSE 10 500 Sell Active "Will we see 500$?" --dp TestDepot Me


3- Create a depot by import file
==================================

  agentf imp doc/example-depot.imp

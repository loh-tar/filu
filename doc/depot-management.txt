      not very comfortable to use.

1- Approach
=============
Depots in Filu are working with a trading rule. For different trading approaches
you have to create different depots. Each depot has a name and an owner which is
not your Linux login name. You can choose any owner you like e.g. 'Me' or
'Grandpa'. Therefore we could say that Filu is multi-tenancy capable. The depot
name may represent your trading strategy. As in real life has a depot a clearing
account and therefore a currency.

When your account currency is different from the market where you place your
order Filu will note the exchange rate. Therefore you must have the currency
data available. NOTE: IIRC there was something buggy :-/

Let's assume your depots are set up nicely. After an update of eodbar data you
can check all depots if any action is needed. Just by running

  agentf depots --check --lso

At the end will be a list with orders printed with suggestions by your trading
rule what to buy or sell.

One suggestion (notice the 'Advice') may looks like:

  All orders for depot: TestDepot, Id: 1, Value: 12.915,44 USD, AvCash: 8.982,44 USD, Positions: 1
  2011-07-22  Sell    10x US0378331005 Apple Inc.      393.30 USD    Advice    Gain > 20

When you trust your rule, place that order as usual at your broker and inform
Filu that we have now an active order.

  agentf add order 2011-07-22 2011-07-29 AAPL NYSE 10 393.30 Sell Active "Gain > 20" --dp 1

In the next days will Filu track if the order was executed and if yes updates
the account and depot. To list the actual depot situation run

  agentf depots --lsd

  All positions for depot: TestDepot, Id: 1, Value: 12.915,44 USD, AvCash: 8.982,44 USD, Positions: 1
  2009-03-19 Apple Inc.                US0378331005    10  101,60 287%  3.933,00  30%

There you can see last buy/sell date, name and symbol, pieces, last self traded price,
performance, actual value and depot portion.


2- Create a depot step by step
================================
Create the depot:

agentf add broker MyBank "5.95 + OV * 0.001"
agentf add depot TestDepot Me SimpleRule USD MyBank

Add an existing position to the depot:

  agentf add depotPos 2009-03-19 AAPL NYSE 10 101.60 "Sadly only fake data" --dp TestDepot Me

Transfer money to the depot account:

  agentf add post 2011-07-22 CashIn "Our fake chance" 8000 --dp TestDepot Me

Place an order:

  agentf add order 2011-02-28 2011-12-31 AAPL NYSE 10 500 Sell Active "Will we see 500$?" --dp TestDepot Me


3- Create a depot by import file
==================================

  agentf imp doc/example-depot.imp


4- Trading simulation
=======================
Besides InspectorF which is running a 'serial test' could you run with AgentF a
'full complex test'. The former simulates one FI after the other over the time
frame and ignore that at the same time maybe some other shares have filled your
depot. The latter is here much more realistic. He check each day the complete
trading setup, which takes much more time.

In fact is it not many more than to create a depot and runs repetitive...

  agentf depots --lso --check --depotId <foo> --from <lastCheck> --to <today>

...where you adjust <lastCheck> and <today> from run to run. And of course you
have to add the advises as active order. When you like to simulate only one year
with daily checks you have a lot...fun.

Apart from the fact that 'simtrade' is pretty ugly, it is also not very smart.
There is still no way to decide which FI to buy if he could choose. Nor could he
sell something what performs disappointing to buy something newer. The first
lucky FI what give a signal is purchased regarding your rule. When the depot is
running out of cash the buy order will noted as 'Canceled', which is not quite
correct.

Try these commands to become an impression.

  agentf imp doc/example-some-us-stocks.imp
  agentf full 2008-01-01

  agentf depots --simtrade SimpleRule USD MyBanK 2009-01-01 2011-01-01 \
                --checkDay Wed --weekly 4 --verbose 0

As you can see I suggest '--weekly 4' which is to reduce the runtime and
'--verbose 0' to show only a (very poor) progress info.

After finish you can investigate the depot like this (adjust the depotId).

  agentf depots --lsd --lso
  agentf depots --lsd --depotId 2 --4day 2009-06-01
  agentf depots --lsd --depotId 2 --4day 2009-07-01
  agentf depots --lsd --depotId 2 --4day 2009-08-01

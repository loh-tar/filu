If you are *not* intended to create new generic FIs then can you skip this
chapter. But if you have an idea for a new Generic FI and you want implement
that, then find you here the needed information how you can do this.


Abstract
==========
Generic FIs are Postgres SQL functions and begin with 'gfi_'. Once you have
create such a file put them into a directory YourAddOn/filu/functions and follow
the notes in doc/hacking-add-ons.txt to install them.


Naming Conventions And Restrictions
=====================================
Input arguments should begin with 'a', intern used Variable names with 'm',
followed by an uppercase letter and should not contain underscores.

Use $BODY$ to quote the entire function.

Prefix the function name, each table reference and each non standard data type
with :filu. That will later replaced at function creation time.


Function Name
===============
Must must have the format 'gfi_<FiType>_<DataType>', all in lowercase letters.
Whereas FiType is the type name of the new FI and DataType the kind of data
returned by the function, e.g. 'gfi_xcurrency_eodbar'.


Function Input And Output Values
==================================
Are fixed and depend on the data type delivered by the funtion.

EodBar
--------
Input:  aFiId        :filu.fi.fi_id%TYPE
        aMarketId    :filu.market.market_id%TYPE
        aFDate       :filu.eodbar.qdate%TYPE       DEFAULT '1000-01-01'
        aTDate       :filu.eodbar.qdate%TYPE       DEFAULT '3000-01-01'
        aLimit       int4                          DEFAULT 0

Output: SETOF :filu.fbar


Register The New Type
=======================
Include in the SQL file an INSERT command to the ftype table with the name of
the new type so that it will be useable. The name can contain uppercase letters,
e.g.

  INSERT INTO :filu.ftype(caption) VALUES('XCurrency');


How It Works
==============
The function has to collect all information he need out of the available tables
to calculate the result. Currently is no special 'generic-attribute-table'
present. So it should be the best to expect them as part of the FiName as done
by xcurrency. But it is also possible to use the underlyling table.


Document Your Type
====================
ToDo! Sugestions are welcome. But surely the user must be informed about the way
the type is to use.

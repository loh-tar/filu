If you are *not* intended to extend the Filu database then can you skip this
chapter. But if you have an idea to improve Filu with new indicators or generic
FIs or with any other stuff to fit some needs then find you here some note how
to add easily your new written extensions to Filu.


In Short
==========
The new written database sqls has to be placed into a directory structure like
the install/source structure with schema and type sub-directories.
Your new add-on tree has therefore to look:

  YourNewAddon
    +--filu
    |    +--table
    |    +--functions
    |    +--views
    |    +--data
    +--user
    |    +--table
    |    +--functions
    |    +--views
    |    +--data
    +--Place access functions direct here

There is no need for the presend of not used sub-directories.

To install and test your new written add-on I suggest to run below your
FiluSource:
  agentf sum testaddon
  filu-install-addon -i <PathTo>/YourNewAddon
  agentf db addon YourNewAddon

For details about the commands run they with -h.

A trading rule file is a plain text file located in ~/Filu/TradingRules by
default. It include a list of settings and rules grouped in blocks and is used
by Trader.cpp.

Trader.cpp calculates some variables noted below which could used at the [Rules]
block. Some of them are exported to the indicator data set. But this means not
that you can use them to do some useful things in an indicator except that you
can plot them.

NOTE: Short trades are not implemented. All hints about short selling should
      kindly be ignored.


Blocks
========
[<BlockType>]
  <BlockType> are Settings and Rules

Lines in the [Settings] block have the format
  <Variable> = <Value>

Lines in the [Rules] block have the format
  <Condition> : <Action>[;<Action>...]


Remarks
=========
*
  Lines begin with an asterisk "*" are ignored


Settings Needed To Do A Real Job
==================================
UseIndicator = <MyIndicator>
  The filename, no surprise

GainRefLong = <IndicatorVariable>
  Default is CLOSE

GainRefShort = <IndicatorVariable>
  Default is CLOSE

PeakRefLong = <IndicatorVariable>
  Default is HIGH

MinPositionSize = <FixValue> FIXME: or <Variable> ?
  In money, default is set to 20% of InitialCash

WorkOnFiGroup = <Group>[, <Group>...]
  Whereas group is the path of one of PerformerF groups.


Settings Needed To Simulate
=============================
FeeFormula = <Expression>
  The expression can contain the variable 'OV' (Order Volume) to calculate the
  commisson. Default is '10 + OV * 0.001'. For details of supported operators
  and functions see: http://muparser.sourceforge.net/mup_features.html#idDef2

InitialCash = <FixValue>
  Default is 5000


Available Variables Related To The Current FI
==============================================
OOLongBuy, OOLongSell
  0..n, not the ordered pieces. It's the count of open orders
  NOTE: used by CalcTrade.cpp

OOShortBuy, OOShortSell
  0..n, not the ordered pieces. It's the count of open orders
  NOTE: used by CalcTrade.cpp

OpenLongBuy, OpenLongSell
  0..n, that's the ordered pieces

OpenShortBuy, OpenShortSell FIXME: not implemented
  0..n, that's the ordered pieces

OpenVolume
  Holds the needed cash for open orders. It could vary from exact amound of
  money if there was multiply orders placed and some of them executed.

Long
  0..n, number of pieces in depot

Short
  0..n, number of pieces in depot

OffMarket
  0/1

AvgLong, AvgShort
  It's the fake averaged entry price of open long/short positions.
  "Fake" because they will set to execution price after a position was sold

RAvgLong, RAvgShort
  The real averaged entry price of open long/short positions

GainLong
  = 100 * (GainRefLong / AvgLong - 1)
  Actual gain of long position in percent

GainShort
  = -100 * (GainRefShort / AvgShort - 1)
  Actual gain of short position in percent

Gain
  = (GainLong + GainShort) / 2
  Actual total gain of open positions in percent

PeakGainLong
  = 100 * (<PeakOf>PeakRefLong - AvgLong) / AvgLong
  Maximum gain of open long position in percent since buy

WonL, LostL, WonS, LostS
  Counts won/lost long/short trades

WonMoney, LostMoney
  Sum the gain/lost of each trade

AvgGainL
  = (AvgGain + 100 * (executedPrice - RAvgLong) / RAvgLong) / 2
  Its the avarage gain in percent per won long trade

AvgLostL
  = (AvgLost + 100 * (RAvgLong - executedPrice) / RAvgLong) / 2
  Its the avarage lost in percent per lost long trade

TotalCommission
  Sum the payed comission over the trading period


Available Variables Related To The Global Scope
=================================================
Cash
  Actual cash

TotalBalance
  Actual total balance


To The Indicator Exported Variables
=====================================
Cash, Gain, GainLong, Long, LostMoney, OffMarket, OOLongBuy, OOLongSell,
TotalBalance, WonMoney

If you need some of the other variables you can modify at Trader.cpp the
function appendMData()


Actions
=========
BUY(<Type>, <Size>[, <Limit>, <Validity>])
  <Type>        Long or Short
  <Size>        In percent from TotalBalance. If not enough cash left, size
                will reduced down to MinPositionSize or droped
  <Limit>       Any indicator variable, default is 'Best' aka next open
  <Condition>   FIXME: not implemented, so forget it ;-)
                Because my bank don't support those things I will ignore
                these nice features
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange)#Time_in_force
  <Validity>    In days, default is 20 (FIXME: well, if we use intraday quotes...)

  BUY(Long, 100)
    Buy on next open for all money left the actual FI

  BUY(Short, 5%, myLimit, 10)


SELL(<Type>, <Size>[, <Limit>, <Validity>])
  <Type>        Long or Short
  <Size>        In percent from holded Long/Short position. If the rest
                position is smaler than MinPositionSize, size will set to 100
  <Limit>       Any indicator variable, default is 'Best' aka next open
  <Validity>    In days, default is 20


Examples
==========
Let us assume we use an indicator MyIndicator witch calculates the variables
ENTERLONG, EXITLONG and LIMITLONG. Than is this a very simple trading rule

  [Settings]
    UseIndicator          = MyIndicator
    InitialCash           = 5000

  [Rules]
    ENTERLONG & OffMarket : BUY (Long, 100%, LIMITLONG);
    EXITLONG & Long       : SELL(Long, 100%);


The same with "take profit"

  [Settings]
    UseIndicator          = MyIndicator
    InitialCash           = 5000

  [Rules]
    ENTERLONG & OffMarket : BUY (Long, 100%);
    EXITLONG & Long       : SELL(Long, 100%);
    Gain > 20             : SELL(Long, 100%);
